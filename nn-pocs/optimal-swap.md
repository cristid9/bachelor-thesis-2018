Problem statement
=================

Design a model that, given a list of numbers, predicts the optimal swap for
that list to get as close to sorted as possible.

Sample
------
```
Input: 1, 4, 3, 2
Output: (1, 3)
```
4 has index 1 and 2 has index 3. Doing this swap we get a list *closer* to a sorted one
